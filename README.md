# What is Terrabuild ?
Terrabuild is a tool to maintain and build efficiently monorepos. Terrabuild is language agnostic: it just knows about dependencies and how to build a project:

- describe a workspace (collection of several projects) using a familiar syntax (HCL-like)
- focus on how to build a project and its dependencies: Terrabuild will optimize and run concurrent builds whenever possible
- Terrabuild ships with default extensions but you can implement your own as well
- Terrabuild uses heavy caching and several graph optimizations to make build fast both on CI and dev environment

# Benefits
- focus on project and the big picture, not the nitty-gritty details
- local build is same as CI one
- describe instead of tweak yaml
- ensure consistency and detect impacts earlier in development
- no lock-in: Terrabuild is not intrusive and can be used without modifying your projects
